************************************ virtual environment setup and usage ************************************


A virtual environment is an isolated python working environment
By default pip installs packages into the global environment. Use a virtual environment to isolate various packages and their dependencies 



Things to study
	how to use pip and other python package managers
	install use and manage packages
	how to find and identify quality python packages
	setup repeatable development environments with requirenments files




Virtual Environment Terms and Tools
	which <filename> = prints the path to a file
	python3 -m venv ./<folder name (typically venv)>
	source ./venv/bin/activate = activate the virtual environment
	pip3 list = show installed packages
	pip3 install <package name> = installs a python package
	pip3 freeze > requirements.txt = create a list of venv installed packages into a file called requirements.txt
	deactivate = leave the virtual environment; return to the global environment



Setup Virtual Environment
	mkdir <dir name>
	cd <dir name>
		if not installed - sudo apt install python3.10-venv
	python3 -m venv ./<folder name (typically venv)>
	source ./venv/bin/activate
	pip3 install <package name>
	pip3 freeze > requirements.txt




Clone repository 
source ./veoenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

You can run python -m pip install -r requirements.txt to install all of the specified dependencies at once.
